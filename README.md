#Ludo Python Game API Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrogaski/ludo.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrogaski/ludo) 

__Python library to access various game APIs.__

Ludo is a native Python client for the web-based APIs provided for
World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Minecraft.  Ludo provides a (relatively)
consistent, object-oriented interface to these APIs, along with a simple
set of caching classes.  Ludo is written for both Python 2 and Python 3.
