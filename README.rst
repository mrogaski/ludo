|Build Status|

**Python library to access various game APIs.**

Ludo is a native Python client for the web-based APIs provided for World
of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Minecraft. Ludo provides a (relatively)
consistent, object-oriented interface to these APIs, along with a simple
set of caching classes. Ludo is written for both Python 2 and Python 3.
